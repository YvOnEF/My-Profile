					<h1>Personal Information</h1>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>My name is Yifan Shen, Yvon is my English name. I am from Shanghai, an international metropolis located in the middle of the eastern coastline of China. I have been in Melbourne for about three years. I’ve got my high school education in Balwyn High School majoring in Software Development and Mathematics, including Specialist Maths, Maths Methods and Further Maths. The major for further education that I pursue here in RMIT is Information Technology. In my leisure time, I have a great number of hobbies. Playing the piano can be one of them. The road of learning the piano has not been all smooth sailing. Because of my keen interest in piano in kindergarten, I started to learn to play the piano. Nevertheless, in the process of practicing, I felt tired since the variety of etudes, which was obviously not the same as my original intention of wanting to play the outstanding works of famous composers. I tried to give up, but with the encouragement of my parents, I gained motivation and I chose to face it bravely. Finally, I got great score in the tenth level of piano, which is also the highest level in China’s piano grade examination, when I was in Grade 6. Later, when I have songs that I want to play, including popular music I like, I can play them easily. I have also developed a good habit of “doing one thing, either don’t do it or do it to the extreme”. Of course, doing sports is also an integral part of my life. In my spare time, I love road-bike cycling. During the ride, I can not only relax my mind, exercise my body, but also enjoy the beautiful scenery along the way. I also enjoy playing tennis, basketball and badminton. Collecting things is also one of my favourite hobbies, ranging from sneakers, Pokémon cards, coins, stamps, etc. My most-liked thing to do on vocations is to travel. It is undoubtedly a fantastic thing to go and see where you want to go, photographing and discover the beauty of the earth. The place I most look forward to is Antarctica. For photography, for adventure, for icebergs, for wildlife, for another world…</p>

					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>This will be an app that provides statistics and feedback on source credibility and bias. The app will access the user’s Chrome browsing history and YouTube watching history. The software will evaluate these sources and give a report on the credibility and bias of them. This app is designed to combat the effect of different algorithms that display articles and videos that users like to see and lead users’ using experience to the extreme. Ultimately, this will cause users to be isolated from different opinions and the truth. By using this app and getting the feedback from the reports, users can avoid getting isolated by these algorithms and get a better browsing experience. However, there is a disadvantage of such an app: accessing user data and browsing history may cause privacy concerns for some.</p>

					<h2>Motivation</h2>
					<p>According to safari digital, more than 86.5% of Australians are online with the average daily usage time exceedingly more than 3 hours each day. There are about 21.93 million active Australian Internet users each month. Therefore, people will be in great demand for this piece of software. The app I’m going to design will be presented simply and follow the guidelines of a normal app. It will have features that can access tools of the mobile (considering it must be touchscreen) like the camera or web browser, and the network. The application’s algorithm will focus on analysing the news and articles on the Internet. It provides statistical feedback on source credibility and bias, doesn’t leak user privacy and doesn’t interfere with user judgment, and does apply to a broader user audience. The advantage of this app is that it won’t interfere with a user's judgment by blocking information and this app is a great solution to solve the problem. It only provides statistical data as a reference and provide more information to help users to make judgments if the contents are credible or not by themselves.</p>

					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>For the primary features, the app will provide feedback on users’ browsing history. The application will access the user's browsing history such as web browsing history and YouTube watching history and will evaluate the credibility of the source and provide statistical feedback. For example, one of the feedbacks is that the app will show a bar chart with two columns. One indicates the percentage of unbiased sources; the other bar chart indicates the percentage of biased sources and unbiased sources. The users then can have a visualization of what level of bias is the information he usually browses. The benefit of the feature is that it helps prevent people from being trapped by filter bubbles unconsciously and let people be aware of the misinformation.
The app will also provide a credibility score. The application can take a picture or a video of any news interface and give a score to inform the users whether that news or article is credible. For instance, if a user wants to verify the credibility of an Instagram post, he/she can take a screenshot, and upload the photo to the application, then the application will give a score ranging from 0 to 100, which 100 represents credited news and 0 represents fake news. The benefit of the score credibility is that it avoids absolute binary answers which are wrong or right. This keeps the application neutral and unbiased and stimulates the users to think critically. For example, if a news item is 90% credited, the user might want to read more relevant news to verify the remaining 10%.
For the secondary features, the app has the function of content sharing. Within the application, users can send and share the content of information to whoever they would like to send it to. This ensures the participation of users across a larger audience and become much more convenient to share.
Additionally, citation tool is another functionality of the app. If a user has some questions regarding an article or news page, our application will have a small feature that you can tap on to get the publication of that source. The application will
reach out and find the correct credentials, citations, authors, etc.</p>

					<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
					<p>Making this software requires a laptop/computer that supports the Python programming language and runs smoothly. The python programming app needs to be downloaded as the lateset version Python 3.x. During the interface design section, figma can be used as a tool to sketch out what an idealized runtime interface would look like.          </p>
