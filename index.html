					<h1>Personal Information</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>My name is Yifan Shen, Yvon is my English name. I am from Shanghai, an international metropolis located in the middle of the eastern coastline of China. I have been in Melbourne for about three years. I’ve got my high school education in Balwyn High School majoring in Software Development and Mathematics, including Specialist Maths, Maths Methods and Further Maths. The major for further education that I pursue here in RMIT is Information Technology. In my leisure time, I have a great number of hobbies. Playing the piano can be one of them. The road of learning the piano has not been all smooth sailing. Because of my keen interest in piano in kindergarten, I started to learn to play the piano. Nevertheless, in the process of practicing, I felt tired since the variety of etudes, which was obviously not the same as my original intention of wanting to play the outstanding works of famous composers. I tried to give up, but with the encouragement of my parents, I gained motivation and I chose to face it bravely. Finally, I got great score in the tenth level of piano, which is also the highest level in China’s piano grade examination, when I was in Grade 6. Later, when I have songs that I want to play, including popular music I like, I can play them easily. I have also developed a good habit of “doing one thing, either don’t do it or do it to the extreme”. Of course, doing sports is also an integral part of my life. In my spare time, I love road-bike cycling. During the ride, I can not only relax my mind, exercise my body, but also enjoy the beautiful scenery along the way. I also enjoy playing tennis, basketball and badminton. Collecting things is also one of my favourite hobbies, ranging from sneakers, Pokémon cards, coins, stamps, etc. My most-liked thing to do on vocations is to travel. It is undoubtedly a fantastic thing to go and see where you want to go, photographing and discover the beauty of the earth. The place I most look forward to is Antarctica. For photography, for adventure, for icebergs, for wildlife, for another world…

					<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p> My interest in IT started while I was a little kid. When I was in primary school, I found that it was such an amazing thing that you can use the web browser to search the things you would like to know and sort out quickly. I'd like to know how the algorithm works and I'm curious how the developers programme to make our world convenient and intelligent. Throughout high school, because of my strong interest in IT, I have studied Applied Computing and Software Development. Computers have always given me a platform to demonstrate my creativity and increase my general knowledge. For my previous coursework, I designed a project plan which related to the COVID-19 drone monitoring in Applied Computing and made a program which I called it for "Filter Bubble" in Software Development. This gave me a great number of experiences in IT. In my spare time, I sometimes create some small programs, testing out new functions or combining old features which provides me a good opportunity to see my progress as a software developer. I choose to come to RMIT because RMIT is well known and worldwide recognised for its IT and Design degree and RMIT has huge amounts of fantastic career opportunities to provide for no matter students' internship or the graduated students. During my studies of Bachelor of Information Technology, I expect to learn iPhone Software Engineering and Cybersecurity. By doing this, I can know how I can design, implement and deploy Apple applications using an appropriate software development environment. I can also learn how to examine a company's security setup from a holistic view. If you would like to ask me, who's the person sparked my interest initially, surely Steve Jobs. </p>

					<h2>Results of these tests</h2>
					<p> From the results of these tests, I found that I am receptive. Although sometimes I don't agree with someone, I will also recognize his/her right to speak out the truth. Everyone can count on my personality type to see my commitment and responsibility. From this point, it can be seen that I'm reliable. From the altruistic personality, I genuinely believe that if I bring people together, I can make them feel very happy. I'm also passionate and charismatic. Firmness and inspiring are my strengths, I often find my way into leadership roles. As a person high in Openness, I am more able than the average person to connect seemingly unrelated concepts. This makes me more creative and imaginative than average, and more likely to appreciate unusual ideas. I have ability of self-discipline and control in order to pursue my goals. However, I also have weaknesses. Sometimes I may feel anxiety, but this will be a very short process because of my low percentage of Neuroticism score. I can get rid of it and move on. Furthermore, I may sometimes overly idealistic and become unrealistic. I put pressure on myself to right every wrong that I encounter. But no matter how hard I strive; it just isn't realistic for me to solve all the world's problems.</p>
					<h3>Behaviour in a team based on these results</h3>
					<p> My tolerance and easy sociability make it easy for me to relate to my team members. I am organized and determined and can forego immediate gratification for the sake of long-term achievement, leading the team to the final success. I have good kinesthetics, so I would rather participate the team discussion than watch. Additionally, auditory style learning is helpful in the classroom environment. I can easily comprehend, process and retain information through the group discussion. Moreover, I can not only use insight and creativity to help others in my team when they meet problem, but also solve logical problems with rational, complex analysis.  </p>
					<h3>Things to take into account when forming a team</h3>
					<p> As the Myers-Briggs test, I would consider myself as a protagonist. Hence, I strongly believe that I can lead my group to the ultimate victory with the personality that I have. Sometimes some problems cannot be solved by me alone. At this time, teamwork is needed to overcome the problem together. Forming a group is all about relying on each other's strengths to stimulates creative ideas and new solutions and allows a more vibrant atmosphere to work with. In doing so, I can make up for my shortcomings, and achieve the best results by gathering the energy of all members of the group to discuss and solve problems together.</p>

				<h1>Project Idea</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>This will be an app that provides statistics and feedback on source credibility and bias. The app will access the user’s Chrome browsing history and YouTube watching history. The software will evaluate these sources and give a report on the credibility and bias of them. This app is designed to combat the effect of different algorithms that display articles and videos that users like to see and lead users’ using experience to the extreme. Ultimately, this will cause users to be isolated from different opinions and the truth. By using this app and getting the feedback from the reports, users can avoid getting isolated by these algorithms and get a better browsing experience. However, there is a disadvantage of such an app: accessing user data and browsing history may cause privacy concerns for some.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Motivation</h2>
					<p>According to safari digital, more than 86.5% of Australians are online with the average daily usage time exceedingly more than 3 hours each day. There are about 21.93 million active Australian Internet users each month. Therefore, people will be in great demand for this piece of software. The app I’m going to design will be presented simply and follow the guidelines of a normal app. It will have features that can access tools of the mobile (considering it must be touchscreen) like the camera or web browser, and the network. The application’s algorithm will focus on analysing the news and articles on the Internet. It provides statistical feedback on source credibility and bias, doesn’t leak user privacy and doesn’t interfere with user judgment, and does apply to a broader user audience. The advantage of this app is that it won’t interfere with a user's judgment by blocking information and this app is a great solution to solve the problem. It only provides statistical data as a reference and provide more information to help users to make judgments if the contents are credible or not by themselves.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>For the primary features, the app will provide feedback on users’ browsing history. The application will access the user's browsing history such as web browsing history and YouTube watching history and will evaluate the credibility of the source and provide statistical feedback. For example, one of the feedbacks is that the app will show a bar chart with two columns. One indicates the percentage of unbiased sources; the other bar chart indicates the percentage of biased sources and unbiased sources. The users then can have a visualization of what level of bias is the information he/she usually browses. The benefit of the feature is that it helps prevent people from being trapped by filter bubbles unconsciously and let people be aware of the misinformation.
The app will also provide a credibility score. The application can take a picture or a video of any news interface and give a score to inform the users whether that news or article is credible. For instance, if a user wants to verify the credibility of an Instagram post, he/she can take a screenshot, and upload the photo to the application, then the application will give a score ranging from 0 to 100, which 100 represents credited news and 0 represents fake news. The benefit of the score credibility is that it avoids absolute binary answers which are wrong or right. This keeps the application neutral and unbiased and stimulates the users to think critically. For example, if a news item is 90% credited, the user might want to read more relevant news to verify the remaining 10%.</p>
          <p>For the secondary features, the app has the function of content sharing. Within the application, users can send and share the content of information to whoever they would like to send it to. This ensures the participation of users across a larger audience and become much more convenient to share.
Additionally, citation tool is another functionality of the app. If a user has some questions regarding an article or news page, our application will have a small feature that you can tap on to get the publication of that source. The application will
reach out and find the correct credentials, citations, authors, etc. Furthermore, the app also has the database storage. Some users may want to save a source for future reading, or for reference. The information of what content is being saved can be applied to the algorithm which can help the developers understand the type of content users liked to have saved on their devices.</p>

					<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
					<p>Making this software requires a laptop/computer that supports the Python programming language and runs smoothly. The python programming app needs to be downloaded as the latest version Python 3.x. During the interface design section, Figma can be used as a tool to sketch out what an idealized runtime interface would look like. In the development phase, the project manager is used to control the development progress of the project, and by using the Gantt Chart to show the progress of the project and a list of specific tasks. By doing so, to classify, manage unfinished tasks and completed tasks, and control the overall progress of the project at any time.       </p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Skills Required</h2>
					<p>During the development process, PyCharm software is required. PyCharm is a Python IDE (Integrated Development Environment). The IDE has functions such as debugging, syntax highlighting, project management, code jumping, smart prompts, unit testing, version control, etc. These are the things which can greatly improve the development efficiency of python. The development of programming with Python requires knowledge of its syntax and functions. The hardware must meet the requirements of PyCharm installation and operation. It is recommended to have 8GB of total system RAM and SSD drive with at least 5 GB of free space. 1920*1080 monitor resolution, Multi-core CPU and latest 64-bit version of Windows, macOS or Linux are also recommended.            </p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Outcome</h2>
					<p> If the project is successful, the app will provide feedback on users’ browsing histories and give out the credibility scores. Users can share content and use citation tools to get the publication of the source they want. The original problem will be solved by synthesizing the Phone Application and the web browser Plug-in to provide users statistical feedback on source credibility and bias. Selecting this idea because a web browser extension is limited. It can only be applied on web pages. The original browser data and browsing history on user's device will not be accessed. This will address users' privacy concerns. This software can prevent people from being trapped by filter bubbles without and make people be aware of the misinformation. Users can have a visualization of what level of bias is the information he/she usually browses.   </p>
